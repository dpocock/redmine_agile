1. Whatever Debian version you are using, it is necessary to use
   ruby-liquid 2.6.4 or older.  This can be satisfied by obtaining
   ruby-liquid 2.6.1-2 from jessie:

     wget http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/r/ruby-liquid/ruby-liquid_2.6.1-2_all.deb
     sudo dpkg -i ruby-liquid_2.6.1-2_all.deb

2. The redmine_crm Gem is required.  I tested v0.0.34.  It can be
   downloaded and built automatically with gem2deb:

     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install gem2deb
     gem2deb redmine_crm

   gem2deb will give an error, press 'y' to ignore it:

     Test "ruby2.3" failed. Continue building the package? (Y/N) y

   If that version is no longer available, it is also possible to obtain
   the version I tested from Github:

     git clone https://github.com/dpocock/ruby-redmine-crm
     cd ruby-redmine-crm
     git checkout debian/sid
     dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b
     cd ..

3. Install the redmine_crm package you just built:

     sudo dpkg -i ruby-redmine-crm_0.0.34-1_all.deb

4. Deploy the plugin code from this directory/repository:

     cd ..
     sudo rsync -r redmine_agile /usr/share/redmine/plugins

5. Reconfigure the redmine package and it should make the plugin
   available in all instances:

     sudo dpkg-reconfigure redmine

6. In the browser, log in to Redmine and go to

     Administration -> Plugins -> Redmine Agile Plugin - Configure

   Or browse to https://${YOUR_REDMINE_URL}/settings/plugin/redmine_agile

   If an error page appears, check /var/log/redmine/default/production.log

7. Select one of your projects in Redmine (or create one), go to

     Settings -> Modules

   Put a tick next to 'Agile' and click 'Save'

8. Now you should see the 'Agile' tab, click it to see the agile board.

9. On the main Project list page, click 'View All Issues'.  The list
   of all issues in all projects appears.  On the right hand side-bar,
   click the 'Agile Board' link.
